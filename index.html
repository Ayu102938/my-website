            <h2>Self Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Hello. I am originally from Southeast Asia and currently living in East Asia. Being trilingual in
                English, Japanese, and Thai allows me to bridge cultures and access a wide range of global information.
                I aspire to become an engineer who can contribute internationally by leveraging both language and
                technical skills. My interest in programming began at an international school, where ICT was a required
                subject. I joined a programming club, where I learned the basics of Python and computer mechanics. I
                applied this knowledge by building a custom PC and setting up a multiplayer game server, which gave me
                valuable hands-on experience with hardware and network configuration. I’m particularly interested in AI,
                VR, servers, and cybersecurity. I am currently studying ICT at university, where I continue to explore
                how cutting-edge technologies can be used to solve real-world problems. I’m especially passionate about
                using eco-friendly AI solutions and developing VR technologies for medical applications, such as
                assisting surgeons during operations. My long-term goal is to contribute to innovative global projects
                that improve lives through technology.
